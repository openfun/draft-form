[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/openfun/verna/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/openfun/verna/tree/main)

An extensible form builder based on [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).

## Overview

Verna is a React component to build forms that generates a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)
description of the form as output. The form can then be rendered with the [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form)
library, which makes it fully extensible to fit your needs.
