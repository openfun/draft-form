# Verna üèó
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/openfun/verna/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/openfun/verna/tree/main)

An extensible form builder based on [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).

## Demos
To demonstrate verna capabilities, we developed several use case examples.
- Basic form playground:[üëÄ Live demo](https://openfun.github.io/verna/playground), [üßë‚Äçüíª Source code](https://github.com/openfun/verna/tree/main/examples/playground)

## Overview

Verna is a React component to build forms that generates a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)
description of the form as output. The form can then be rendered with the [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form)
library, which makes it fully extensible to fit your needs.

## Quick preview
 
You can check examples available within the `examples` folder. Take a loot at the
`README.md` file in each example then follow instructions to run it.

### Instructions

üöß **`@openfun/verna` is not yet available on NPM. Stay tuned !**
Soon instructions to install `@openfun/verna` within your project.

To run the project, you have to run :
1. `yarn install` 
2. `yarn dev`

You should now be able to access the playground example from http://localhost:3000

### Project structure (Yarn workspaces)

This repository is a monorepo based on Yarn workspace to organize code.
Workspaces are located in two directories `lib` and `examples`. You can get info on all existing
workspace through `yarn workspaces info` command.
In `lib`, there is the `@openfun/verna` workspace that is the project itself which will be published
on npm then the `examples` directory aims to contain all the examples to demonstrate feature of
Verna.

#### Scripts

Through Yarn workspace, you are able to launch main commands from the root of this repository.
Here are the available commands:

- `yarn build`: Build the `@openfun/verna` library for production.
- `yarn dev`: Build and watch `@openfun/verna` library then start development server from the
  example workspace define through the environment variable `VERNA_EXAMPLE` (by default it uses
  `verna-examples-playground`, take a look at `examples` directory to see all examples available)
- `yarn lint`: Lint the code of all workspaces.
- `yarn test`: Run test suites from `@openfun/verna` workspace.
