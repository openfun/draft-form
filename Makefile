# This Makefile is only meant to be used for DEVELOPMENT purpose as we are

# Note to developers:
#
# While editing this file, please respect the following statements:
#
# 1. Every variable should be defined in the ad hoc VARIABLES section with a
#    relevant subsection
# 2. Every new rule should be defined in the ad hoc RULES section with a
#    relevant subsection depending on the targeted service
# 3. Rules should be sorted alphabetically within their section
# 4. When a rule has multiple dependencies, you should:
#    - duplicate the rule name to add the help string (if required)
#    - write one dependency per line to increase readability and diffs
# 5. .PHONY rule statement should be written after the corresponding rule

# -- Node
# We must run node with a /home because yarn tries to write to ~/.yarnrc. If the
# ID of our host user (with which we run the container) does not exist in the
# container (e.g. 1000 exists but 1009 does not exist by default), then yarn
# will try to write to "/.yarnrc" at the root of the system and will fail with a
# permission error.
